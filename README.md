Hello!

My name is Roman, and I am a software engineering student at ASU.
I have joined GitHub to learn more about the platform and to hopefully contribute to some
interesting projects. I am currently in my junior year of college, which means I have a good
foundation of coding knowledge. I would like to contribute to projects here to learn more about 
real-world programming projects, and to practice what I have learned so far.
